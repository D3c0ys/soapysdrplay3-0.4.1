# soapysdrplay3-0.4.1
Arch Linux soapysdrplay3 packages by D3c0y

SoapySDR is the driver subsystem in the Pothosware ecosystem. It provides a specification for drivers, and a management layer required to use them. Individual drivers are dynamically linked, discovered, and loaded, so they can be maintained independently of the SoapySDR user (GNU Radio in this case).
